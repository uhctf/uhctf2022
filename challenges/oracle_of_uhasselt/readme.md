    <summary><strong>5%</strong>: How to interact properly with the oracle.</summary>
    Did you try asking the oracle about the hint she gave you? Maybe if you twist her words, she will yell at you for a valid reason?

    <summary><strong>30%</strong>: Points you into the right research direction.</summary>
    The oracle loves giving feedback. Some say the nicest thing she can say is: `The oracle understands your struggles...`. But for me, `Padding is incorrect.` is a lot more meaningful.

    The oracle came to my office earlier. She complained about students attacking her with incorrectly padded questions. They were trying to deduce the meaning of her prophecies based on her reactions!

## Description
The Oracle of Hasselt University has been guiding students since ancient times. However, without her coffee she just mumbles some weird incantations. Are you able to decypher her caffeine-deprived prophecies? Feel free to question her as much as you want!
