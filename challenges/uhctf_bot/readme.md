    <summary><strong>15%</strong>: What quirk should you research?</summary>
    I remember doing `console.log({})` in my browser once. Objects seem to contain a lot of weird stuff in JavaScript. Wonder what that is all about?

    Prototype pollution is the result of incorrect implementation of a specific functionality. Maybe the bot's author already had their doubts during development?

## Description
The Python Discord API got deprecated so I had to write our bot in JavaScript. It's only a prototype, yet I feel defiled. My hands touched the impure.

But what about the code? It doesn't look too dirty yet, but who knows what people can do with it?
