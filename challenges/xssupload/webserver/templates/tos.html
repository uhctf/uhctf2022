            <p>Our Transfers Team will make every effort to help you move your website to us. Transfers are provided as
                a courtesy service. We do not make any guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time
                required to complete an account transfer. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some
                hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely
                difficult, if not impossible, to migrate some or all account data. In some cases we may not be able to
                assist you in a transfer of data from an old host. The free transfer service is available for thirty
                (30) days from your sign up date. Transfers outside of the thirty (30) day period will incur a charge;
                please contact a member of our Transfers department to receive a price quote. In no event shall Dummy
                Solutions be held liable for any lost or missing data or files resulting from a transfer to or from
                Dummy Solutions. You are solely responsible for backing up your data in all circumstances.</p>

                            you and allow time for you to change or update your password before suspending your account.

                    before, canceled and signed up again, or if you have opened a second account with us, you will not
                    be eligible for a refund.&nbsp;<strong>Violations of this Agreement will waive your rights under the

                    There are no refunds on dedicated servers, administrative fees, and install fees for custom
                    software. Please note that domain refunds will only be considered if the domain was ordered in
                    conjunction with a hosting package and will be issued at Dummy Solutions’s sole discretion. Any
                    refunds issued for domain names will be reduced by the market value of the gTLD. Purchases of ccTLDs
                    are non-refundable.</li>
                <li><strong>Cancellation Process.</strong><br>
                    You may terminate or cancel the Services by giving Dummy Solutions written notice. In such event:
                    (i) you shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such
                    cancellation and (ii) Dummy Solutions may, in our sole discretion, refund all pre-paid fees for
                    basic hosting services for the full months remaining after the effectiveness of such cancellation
                    (i.e. no partial month fees shall be refunded) less any setup fees, applicable taxes and any
                    discount applied for prepayment, provided that you are not in breach of this Agreement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once we receive your cancellation form and have confirmed all necessary information with you via email,
                we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been canceled. Your cancellation
                confirmation will contain a ticket/tracking number in the subject line for your reference and for
                verification purposes. You should immediately receive an automatic email with a tracking number stating
                that “Your request has been received….” Dummy Solutions will confirm your request and process your
                cancellation shortly thereafter.<br>
                We require all cancellations to be done through the online form in order to (a) confirm your identity,
                (b) confirm in writing that you are prepared for all of your files and emails to be removed, and (c)
                document the request. This process aims to reduce the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious
                requests, and to ensure that you are aware that your files, emails, and account may be removed
                immediately and permanently after a cancellation request is processed.</p>
            <p>Cancellations for shared and reseller accounts will be effective on the account’s renewal date.

                    cancel any domain registration&nbsp;at least thirty (30) days prior to the renewal date. No refunds
                    will be given once a domain is renewed. All domain registrations and renewals are final.</li>
                <li><strong>Foreign Currencies.</strong><br>
                    Exchange rate fluctuations for international payments are constant and unavoidable. All refunds are
                    processed in U.S. dollars and will reflect the exchange rate in effect on the date of the refund.
                    All refunds are subject to this fluctuation and Dummy Solutions is not responsible for any change in
                    exchange rates between the time of payment and the time of refund.</li>

                    determined by Dummy Solutions in our sole discretion; or (iv) as otherwise specified in this
                    Agreement. In such event, Dummy Solutions shall not refund to you any fees paid in advance of such
                    termination, and you shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the
                    effectiveness of such termination. Additionally, Dummy Solutions may charge you for all fees due for
                    the Services for the remaining portion of the then current term.<br>

                    for resellers, dedicated or VPS servers, which are subject to the terms of the plan you purchased
                    and can be viewed in your control panel.</li>

            <ol start="15">
                <li><strong>Uptime Guarantee.</strong><br>
                    If your shared or reseller server has a physical downtime that falls short of the 99.0% uptime
                    guarantee, you may receive one (1) month of credit on your account. This uptime guarantee does not
                    apply to planned maintenance. Approval of any credit is at the sole discretion of Dummy Solutions
                    and may be dependent upon the justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not
                    be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor’s network
                    capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the
                    operating system and the Apache Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by other
                    individual services. To request a credit, please create a support ticket to our Billing department
                    with justification [within thirty (7) days of the end of the month for which you are requesting a
                    credit]. Uptime guarantees only apply to shared and reseller solutions. Dedicated servers are
                    covered by a network guarantee in which the credit is prorated for the amount of time the server is
                    down which is not related to our uptime guarantee.</li>
                <li><strong>Reseller Terms and Client Responsibility</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>. Resellers shall ensure that each of their clients complies with this Agreement.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Resellers are responsible for supporting their clients. Dummy Solutions does not provide support to
                    clients of Dummy Solutions’s resellers. If a reseller’s client contacts Dummy Solutions, Dummy
                    Solutions reserves the right to place a reseller client account on hold until the reseller can
                    assume responsibility for the reseller’s client. All support requests must be made by the reseller
                    on its client’s behalf for security purposes.</li>
                <li>Resellers are also responsible for all content stored or transmitted under their reseller account
                    and the actions of their clients. Dummy Solutions will hold any reseller responsible for any of
                    their client’s actions that violate the law or this Agreement.</li>
                <li>Dummy Solutions is not responsible for the acts or omissions of our resellers. The reseller hereby
                    agrees to indemnify Dummy Solutions from and against any and all claims made by any User arising
                    from the reseller’s acts or omissions.</li>
                <li>Dummy Solutions reserves the right to revise our Reseller Program at any time. Changes shall take
                    effect when posted online or on any subsequent date as may be set forth by Dummy Solutions.</li>
                <li>Resellers in the Dummy Solutions Reseller Program assume all responsibility for billing and
                    technical support for each of the Users signed up by the reseller.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="17">
                <li><strong>Shared (non-reseller accounts)</strong><br>
                    Shared accounts may not be used to resell web hosting to others. If you wish to resell hosting you
                    must use a reseller account.</li>
                <li><strong>Dedicated Servers</strong><br>
                    Dummy Solutions reserves the right to reset the password on a dedicated server if the password on
                    file is not current so that we may do security audits as required by our datacenter. It is your
                    responsibility to ensure that there is a valid email address and current root password on file for
                    your dedicated server to prevent downtime from forced password resets. Dummy Solutions reserves the
                    right to audit servers as needed and to perform administrative actions at the request of our
                    datacenter. Dedicated servers are NOT backed up by us. It is your responsibility to maintain
                    backups. Dedicated servers that have invoices outstanding for more than ten (10) days may be subject
                    to deletion which will result in the loss of all data on the server. Dummy Solutions will not be
                    liable for any loss of data resulting from such deletion.</li>
                <li><strong>Price Change</strong><br>
                    Dummy Solutions reserves the right to change prices or any other charges at any time. We will
                    provide you with at least thirty (30) days notice before charging you with any price change on any
                    annual or longer term plans. It is your sole responsibility to periodically review billing
                    information provided by Dummy Solutions through the user billing tool or through other methods of
                    communication, including notices sent or posted by Dummy Solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Coupons</strong><br>
                    Discounts and coupon codes are reserved for first-time accounts or first-time customers only and may
                    not be used towards the purchase of a domain registration unless otherwise specified. If you have
                    previously signed up using a particular domain, you may not sign up again for that domain using
                    another coupon at a later date. Any account found in violation of these policies will be reviewed by
                    our Sales department and the appropriate charges will be added to the account. Coupon abuse will not
                    be tolerated and may result in the suspension or termination of your account. All coupons and
                    discounts are only valid towards the initial purchase and do not affect the renewal or recurring
                    price.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
                    IN NO EVENT WILL DUMMY SOLUTIONS ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD
                    PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
                    INCLUDING FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY USER
                    CONTENT, USER WEBSITES OR OTHER MATERIALS ACCESSED OR DOWNLOADED THROUGH THE SERVICES, EVEN IF DUMMY
                    SOLUTIONS IS AWARE OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
                    NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, DUMMY SOLUTIONS’S LIABILITY TO YOU, OR
                    ANY PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU, FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION,
                    IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO DUMMY SOLUTIONS FOR THE SERVICES IN THE THREE (3)
                    MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMIT. THE
                    EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM HEREUNDER WILL NOT INCREASE THIS LIMIT.</li>
                <li><strong>Indemnification</strong><br>
                    You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Dummy Solutions, our affiliates, and their
                    respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an “Indemnified Party” and, collectively,
                    the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, suits,
                    actions, demands, proceedings (whether legal or administrative), and expenses (including, but not
                    limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees) threatened, asserted, or filed by a third party against any
                    of the Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to (i) your use of the Services, (ii) any
                    breach or violation by you of this Agreement; or (iii) any acts or omissions by you. The terms of
                    this section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitration</strong><br>
                    By using the Services, you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration
                    Association (“AAA”) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of this
                    Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator chosen by Dummy Solutions
                    and will be held at the AAA location chosen by Dummy Solutions in Texas. Payment of all filing,
                    administrative and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in
                    this paragraph. In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be
                    prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Dummy Solutions will pay as much of your filing,
                    administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems
                    necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitration before the AAA
                    shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a
                    class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on
                    behalf of others. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all
                    arbitration under this paragraph. All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and
                    final. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator’s authority to
                    resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and Dummy Solutions alone. Claims
                    may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties. No arbitration award
                    or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is
                    not a named party to the arbitration. If you initiate litigation or any other proceeding against
                    Dummy Solutions in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay Dummy Solutions’s reasonable costs
                    and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with our enforcement of this paragraph.</li>
                <li><strong>Independent Contractor</strong><br>
                    Dummy Solutions and User are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement places
                    Dummy Solutions and User in the relationship of principal and agent, partners or joint venturers.
                    Neither party has, expressly or by implication, or may represent itself as having, any authority to
                    make contracts or enter into any agreements in the name of the other party, or to obligate or bind
                    the other party in any manner whatsoever.</li>
                <li><strong>Governing Law; Jurisdiction</strong><br>
                    Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the formation of this
                    Agreement or the breach of this Agreement, including any claim based upon an alleged tort, shall be
                    governed by the substantive laws of the State of Texas. The United Nations Convention on Contracts
                    for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</li>
                <li><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br>
                    Dummy Solutions shall not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer. Dummy Solutions
                    makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied for the Services. Dummy Solutions disclaims
                    any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, including loss of data
                    resulting from delays, delivery failures, wrong deliveries, and any and all service interruptions
                    caused by Dummy Solutions or our employees.</li>
                <li><strong>Backups and Data Loss</strong><br>
                    Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. Dummy Solutions’s backup service runs once a week and
                    overwrites any of our previous backups. Only one week of backups are kept at a time. This service is
                    provided only to shared and reseller accounts as a courtesy and may be modified or terminated at any
                    time at Dummy Solutions’s sole discretion. Dummy Solutions does not maintain backups of dedicated
                    accounts. Dummy Solutions is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You
                    agree to take full responsibility for all files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate
                    backup of files and data stored on Dummy Solutions’s servers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Any shared account using more than 20 gigs of disk space will be removed from our off site weekly backup
                with the exception of databases continuing to be backed up. All data will continue to be mirrored to a
                secondary drive to help protect against data loss in the event of a drive failure.</p>
