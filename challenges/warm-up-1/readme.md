    <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef">CyberChef</a> is an excellent
    tool for converting between many different types of data. CyberChef can
    often guess which conversions would make the most sense; simply paste your
    data in the input field, and click the magic wand above the output field
    if it appears. If not, you can easily play with the different conversion options yourself.
