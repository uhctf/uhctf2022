## Description
During a network assessment we uncovered this weird port on the network. It seems to belong to a Wi-Fi range extender. Can you find out whether it is somehow vulnerable and get us the flag?

Note:
- the flag is located in the root (`/`) directory of the device.
- a firewall is placed in front of the device. Ports aside from the ones given will not be accessible.
